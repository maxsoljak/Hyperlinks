  <h1>Welcome to basically my life</h1>
  <p>I am an international student pursuing a double major in Cybersecurity and Computer Science at Anderson University, which I also proudly represent and compete for in the Track and Field team. 
    My academic and personal passion for this field began at very young age but mostly at Business Academy Dusni, where I majored in Computer Science in Business and developed a strong foundation for working with tools like: All Microsoft office products, administrative roles, linux, basics of programming, but also a leadership roles such as a Class President for my whole duration of attendance.
    I love working around and with people and I am passionate about expanding my network and connecting with individuals who share the same vision and drive for success as I do.</p>
